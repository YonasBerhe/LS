			<h2 align="center">Thank you for participating!<br/></h2>

<p>Feel free to use the Sinasprite as often as you need it and do the activities that work best for you. <font color="green"><b>We recommend using it at least once a day.</b></font> If you have problems with any of the steps, need help, or want to give feedback, please contact us at socks@litesprite.com.<br/></p>
<p><h3>INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>1. Accept the invitation you received to join a google group or iTunes connect. Download the app through the link. <b>NOTE:</b> iOS users will need to have Testflight installed in order to download the app. Check your spam folder if you don’t see an invite. If Testflight hangs, exit Testflight and see if there a Sinasprite icon on your phone. If there is, try to launch the app. The documentation we reviewed indicates that the app maybe installed fine but Testflight is hanging. If you have problems, please email us at <a href="mailto:socks@litesprite.com" title="socks@litesprite.com">socks@litesprite.com</a><br/><br/>2. Enter your group and client codes, which were sent via email. <b>NOTE:</b> The buttons are a little sticky (we are trying to fix this), so you may have to tap it lightly or at the top of the “Enter” key or hit it a couple of times to continue. After entering your group and client code your screen should look like this:</p>

<p>Main Components:</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Journal</th>
			<td align="left">Socks guides you through proven stress management techniques. As you do this<br/> regularly, see Sock’s shrine grow and unlock a fishing mini-game and collect fish<br/> with Socks.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Meditation</th>
			<td align="left">Here you will learn basic mediation skills. Create paintings with Socks at the end<br/> of each session.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Oracle</th>
			<td align="left">Answering the questions from the Oracle will unlock an item you can use elsewhere<br/> in Sinasprite. Whenever the Oracle is flashing it means there are new things you can<br/> unlock.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Shrine</th>
			<td align="left">Here you can see your paintings that you created from meditation and the fish you<br/> have caught.<br/><br/><br/></td>
