<p>Welcome! Feel free to use Sinasprite as often as you need it and do the activities that work best for you. </p>

<p><strong style="color:green;">We recommend using it at least once a day.</strong></p>

<p style="color:darkorange;">Once we've confirmed successful completion of your survey, we will send your codes. </p>

DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS: <br>

<ol>
	<li>
	Accept the invitation you received to join a Google group or iTunes connect. Download the app through the link. <strong>NOTE</strong>: iOS users will need to have 
	<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664?mt=8">Testflight</a> installed in order to download the app. Check your spam folder if you don’t see an invite. If Testflight hangs, exit Testflight and see if there a Sinasprite icon on your phone. If there is, try to launch the app. The documentation we reviewed indicates that the app maybe installed fine but Testflight is hanging. 
	</li>
	<li>
	Enter your group and client codes. <strong>NOTE</strong>: The buttons are a little sticky (we are trying to fix this), so you may have to tap it lightly or at the top of the “Enter" key or hit it a couple of times to continue. 
	</li>
</ol>

OVERVIEW MAIN COMPONENTS: Here is a more detailed <a href="https://litesprite.com/pages/tutorial">tutorial</a>. <br>
<ul>
	<li>
	Journal: Socks guides you through proven stress management techniques. As you do this regularly, see Sock's shrine grow and unlock a fishing mini-game and collect fish with Socks.
	</li>
	<li>
	Meditation: Here you will learn basic mediation skills. Create paintings with Socks at the end of each session.
	</li>
	<li>
	Oracle: Answering the questions from the Oracle will unlock an item you can use elsewhere in Sinasprite. Whenever the Oracle is flashing it means there are new things you can unlock.
	</li>
	<li>
	Shrine: Here you can see your paintings that you created from meditation and the fish you have caught.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, if you haven't completed your survey yet we would appreciate if you did that as soon as convenient. The link should be in the introduction letter previously sent to you.</p>
