<p>
    DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS:
</p>
<ol>

<li>Make sure your device is signed into the Google or or Apple account provided to us.</li>
<li>Accept the invitation you received to join a Google group or iTunes connect. Check your spam folder if you don’t see an invite. <strong>NOTE:</strong> iOS users will need to accept the invite via the native Apple email application.
</li>
<li>Download the app through the link. <strong>NOTE:</strong> iOS users will need have <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664?mt=8">Testflight</a> installed in order to download the app. If Testflight hangs, exit Testflight and see if there a Sinasprite icon on your phone. If there is, try to launch the app. The documentation we reviewed indicates that the app maybe installed fine but Testflight is hanging.  
</li>
<li>Enter your group and client codes. <strong>NOTE:</strong> The buttons are a little sticky (we are trying to fix this), so you may have to tap it lightly or at the top of the “Enter" key or hit it a couple of times to continue.

</ol>
<p>
    If you have problems with any of the steps, please let us know.

    OVERVIEW MAIN COMPONENTS: Here are more <a href="https://litesprite.com/pages/tutorial">details</a>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Journal: Socks guides you through proven stress management techniques. As you do this regularly, see Sock\'s shrine grow and unlock a fishing mini-game
    and collect fish with Socks.</li>

    <li>Meditation: Here you will learn basic mediation skills. Create paintings with Socks at the end of each session.</li>

    <li>Oracle: Answering the questions from the Oracle will unlock an item you can use elsewhere in Sinasprite. Whenever the Oracle is flashing it means there
    are new things you can unlock.</li>

    <li>Shrine: Here you can see your paintings that you created from meditation and the fish you have caught.</li>
</ul>
